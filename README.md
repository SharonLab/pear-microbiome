# This is a GitHub repository of the code used for the publication titled: Pear flower and leaf microbiome dynamics during the naturally occuring spread of Erwinia amylovora

The files in this repository have the code for re-creating the results described in the paper. 

The first step is running the script 01.load_data_to_ps_object_rarefy.R, which creates the phyloseq objects used in the rest of the code, using the qiime2 output located in the data folder. 

The rest of the scripts, despite being numbered, can be used in any order.
